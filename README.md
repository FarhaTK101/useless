Project Description
A calculator that gives wrong answers intentionally. Just when you think 2 + 2 is 4, think again—it's 5 (sometimes 3). Perfect for confusing your friends or failing your math test on purpose.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting too many correct answers. The world is filled with logic, order, and accurate math. Where's the fun in that?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a calculator that gives you wrong answers—randomly! Now you can doubt your own brain and laugh with every calculation.
