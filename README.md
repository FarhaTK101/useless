# USELESS CALCULATOR


## Basic Details
### Team Name: PHENIOX


### Team Members

### Project Description
A calculator that gives wrong answers intentionally. Just when you think 2 + 2 is 4, think again—it's 5 (sometimes 3). Perfect for confusing your friends or failing your math test on purpose.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting too many correct answers. The world is filled with logic, order, and accurate math. Where's the fun in that?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a calculator that gives you wrong answers—randomly! Now you can doubt your own brain and laugh with every calculation.
